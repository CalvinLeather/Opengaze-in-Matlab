# Opengaze-in-Matlab
A matlab-based package for communicating with gp3 eyetracker by gazepoint over the opengaze API
Baed in part off of mperez4/gazepoint_toolkit, but with support for more recent matlab and gp3 client versions.
Stable and in use, but still adding features, might change to OOP soonish.

KbWaitEyeTracking and waitForCalirbation are designed to work with Psychtoolbox, and will only work if you have it installed.
